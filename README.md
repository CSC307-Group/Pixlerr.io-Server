### About
For internet communities who want to collaborate on a large art project.  
Pixlerr.io is a globally interactive art canvas that allows users to coordinate individual pixels to create images.  
Unlike r/place, which is only available a few days out of the year, our product is available year round.

### How to use
Clone this repository to a local machine.
Then run the following command three times, once in the main **/Pixlerr.io** directory, once in the **../react-frontend** directory, and once in the **../expressjs-backend** directory:

    npm install

Once packages are installed in all directories, run the following command twice, first in the **../expressjs-backend** directory, and then in the **../react-frontend** directory:

    npm start
    
To place pixels, you must register an account and login. Once logged in, you can place one pixel every minute.  
Changes to the canvas can be seen in real-time to everybody currently accessing it.
